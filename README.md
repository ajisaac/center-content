# Center Content Chrome Plugin

Some websites were designed in the 90s when monitors were 800x600. They are usually text content without any CSS 
styling. This especially occurs on academic websites. But if you have a 32 inch 4k monitor, the text will span accross
the entire page and be difficult to read.

This plugin adds a simple icon to your browser. Click once to turn on, click again to turn off. It simply adds or 
removes 2 styles to the body of the current page.

This plugin is mostly complete. May add a few enhancements, but only a few.

- [ ] Remember settings for domain, so we maintain settings between reloads
- [ ] Allow us to adjust the width
- [ ] Don't mess up margins when unsetting
