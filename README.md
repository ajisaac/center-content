# Center Content Chrome Plugin

Some websites were designed in the 90s when monitors were 800x600. They are usually text content without any CSS 
styling. This especially occurs on academic websites. But if you have a 32 inch 4k monitor, the text will span accross
the entire page and be difficult to read.

This plugin adds a simple on off button to your browser for the current page to center the content and add a maxwidth to
the page.
